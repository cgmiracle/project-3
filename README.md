## Prediction

###Using average season values to predict the first round of the 2019 NBA Playoffs

Gathering numbers that were averages from the season, how likely were the predictions using KNN Classifier going to be?   As you can see in the predictions column and number that was larger than 0.1 predicted a win.  The values used were averages of points, free-throw percentage, three-point percentage, field goal percentage, the number of assists and rebounds per game.  Teams that had high margins during the season as the home team had a strong probability to win.  The outlier is Portland vs. the Lakers.  The numbers might be skewed for the Lakers since their team was influx and they acquired a superstar (Anthony Davis) midseason.   The margin is the subtraction of home points vs. visitor points.
